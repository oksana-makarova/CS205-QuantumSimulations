# Solving Quantum System Dynamics with Exact Diagonalization (ED)

Since Quantum Computation is a challenging topic that might be unfamiliar to some of the readers, we recommend reading either [this review](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0404064) or a [wonderful guide](https://qiskit.org/textbook/preface.html) to quantum compuation with Python by IBM.

The flowchart below provides the basic outline of the computation that will be done
